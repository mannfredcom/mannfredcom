# Thomas Mannfred Carlsson

This GitHub hosts **small, focused public artifacts** from side research and infrastructure work: datasets, measurement tooling, and reference configurations. Professional work lives in private repositories or production systems.

I have long-running **IRC and network-ops roots**. Much of what's here exists because it's useful to that world: practical measurement, abuse visibility, and operational tooling. Data from these projects feeds into [DroneBL](https://dronebl.org/) and [EFnetRBL](https://rbl.efnetrbl.org/).

## What's here

- **Network & security research datasets** - curated data for defensive analysis and tooling validation
- **Infrastructure tooling & configs** - reference configurations for monitoring and operations
- **Notes & experiments** - narrow explorations useful to others

If you run IRC/DNSBL/proxy-monitor pipelines, these are the canonical entry points:
- [`daily-proxy-ips`](https://github.com/mannfredcom/daily-proxy-ips) - daily open proxy exits for local/offline workflows
- [`semi-static-proxy-ips`](https://github.com/mannfredcom/semi-static-proxy-ips) - stability-filtered proxy exits for blocklist seeding
- [`hopm-conf`](https://github.com/mannfredcom/hopm-conf) - HOPM/BOPM scanner configurations

## Intended use

Defensive security research, network measurement, fraud/abuse prevention, and infrastructure experimentation.

**Not** for circumventing safeguards or enabling malicious activity. Datasets are intentionally constrained to reduce misuse risk. If something here creates unintended harm, please contact me.
