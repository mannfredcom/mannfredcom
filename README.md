# Thomas Mannfred Carlsson

This GitHub hosts **small, focused public artifacts** from side research and infrastructure work: datasets, measurement tooling, and reference configurations. My professional work lives in private repositories or production systems.

I also have long-running **IRC and network-ops roots**. Much of what you see here exists because it's useful to that world: practical measurement, abuse visibility, and operational tooling. Data from these projects feeds into the [DroneBL](https://dronebl.org/) and [EFnetRBL](https://rbl.efnetrbl.org/) real-time blocklists.

## What's here

- **Network & security research datasets** – curated, reproducible data for defensive analysis and tooling validation
- **Infrastructure tooling & configs** – lightweight utilities and reference configurations for monitoring and operations
- **Notes & experiments** – narrow explorations useful to others, even if not part of a larger project

Starting points:
- [`semi-static-proxy-ips`](https://github.com/mannfredcom/semi-static-proxy-ips) – longitudinal measurement of open proxy exit IPs (blocklist workflows)
- [`hopm-conf`](https://github.com/mannfredcom/hopm-conf) – hardened reference configuration for proxy monitoring (HOPM/BOPM workflows)

## Intended use

This material is intended for defensive security research, network measurement, fraud/abuse prevention, and infrastructure experimentation.

It is **not** intended for circumventing safeguards or enabling malicious activity. Datasets are intentionally constrained to reduce misuse risk. If you believe something here creates unintended harm, please contact me.
